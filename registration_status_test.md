## API Endpoints Fixed

### ✅ Student Opportunities API (`/api/student/opportunities`)
- Filters out denied registrations when calculating `isRegistered`
- Only counts active registrations (not denied) for volunteer count
- Prevents duplicate registrations (excluding denied ones)

### ✅ Admin Opportunities API (`/api/admin/opportunities`)
- Filters out denied registrations when calculating `totalRegistrations`
- Shows correct counts in opportunity cards

### ✅ Admin Registration Management API (`/api/admin/opportunities/[id]/registrations`)
- GET endpoint now filters out denied registrations
- Only shows active registrations (pending/approved) in modal
- PUT endpoint correctly uses 'denied' enum value

## Expected Behavior

### Student View (`/student/opportunities`):
- **Library Book Sorting**: "Leave" button (registered, pending)
- **Food Bank Distribution**: "Register" button (denied registration doesn't count)
- **Senior Center Activities**: "Register" button (not registered)
- **Animal Shelter Care**: "Register" button (not registered)
- **Garden Cleanup**: "Leave" button (registered, pending)

### Admin View (`/admin/opportunities`):
- **Library Book Sorting**: "View (1)" button → Shows Yatish Grandhe (pending)
- **Food Bank Distribution**: "View (0)" button → No registrations shown
- **Senior Center Activities**: "View (0)" button → No registrations shown
- **Animal Shelter Care**: "View (0)" button → No registrations shown
- **Garden Cleanup**: "View (1)" button → Shows Yatish Grandhe (pending)

## Test Commands

### Verify Student Registration Status:
```sql
SELECT vo.title, reg.status, p.full_name 
FROM volunteer_opportunities vo 
LEFT JOIN opportunity_registrations reg ON vo.id = reg.opportunity_id AND reg.student_id = '19f50d21-361c-4ab6-b925-a679faa81ebf'
LEFT JOIN profiles p ON reg.student_id = p.id
ORDER BY vo.date;
```

### Verify Admin Registration Counts:
```sql
SELECT vo.title, COUNT(reg.id) as total_registrations
FROM volunteer_opportunities vo
LEFT JOIN opportunity_registrations reg ON vo.id = reg.opportunity_id AND reg.status != 'denied'
GROUP BY vo.id, vo.title
ORDER BY vo.date;
```

### Verify Registration Details for Admin Modal:
```sql
SELECT reg.id, reg.status, p.full_name, p.email, p.student_id
FROM opportunity_registrations reg
JOIN profiles p ON reg.student_id = p.id
WHERE reg.opportunity_id = '51db3401-18ab-4275-a72d-a9e189978799'
  AND reg.status != 'denied'
ORDER BY reg.registered_at DESC;
```
